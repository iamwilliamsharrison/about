             My name is Harrison Nzubechi Godson, I am an Altscholar (Student Id: ALT/SOE/023/2189) and a Mechanical Enginner.
          <br>
          I have always had a passion for Information Technology because of it's mistery and how inter-woven it is with our everyday life,
           As a mechnanical Engineer, information technology is at the epicenter of its building block and future.  Over the years i have witnessed
           the beauty of information technology and its application to my Discipline, when it comes to;
           <ul>
            <li> CNC Programming </li>
            <li>Manufacturing Systems </li>
            <li>3d printing</li>
            <li>Application Softwares for project executions, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        I am looking forward to Learn and broaden my knowledge in tech, it's applications and mind blowing innovations. Tech offers tools
        and ways to handle difficult real life problems, I know Altschool also empowers people and connects them on a global scale, 
        encouraging a sense of community and connectivity attached with a good learning schedule, And i am here for it all.
